## Day 1
* A website is responsive by default. If it's not responsive, it's because we've done something to make our website not responsive.
* Percentages in CSS **(%)** are relative to the parent element.
* Avoid using heights.

## Day 2
* **em** is a unit related to the parent element, while **rem** refers to the font size of the root (normally 16 pixels).
* Use **rems** to font sizes and avoid using **ems**.
* **ems** can be used in paddings, margins, widths, etc, especially in buttons, to mantain proportionality.

## Day 3
* Use **max-width** to limit a certain element width to a given point.

## Day 4
* **vw** and **vh** (viewport width and height, respectively) are units related to the screen size.
* These units are particularly useful for proportional titles, padding and margins, for example.

## Days 5, 6 and 7
* Practice Time, review of the week and solution to the challenge.

## Day 8
* Introduction to flexbox and flexbox challenge 01.

## Day 9
* Including images in Flexbox may cause an issue. The image can stretch. **align-items** and **align-self** can solve it.
* **justify-content** can solve another position problems. It'a property that can be used to control the empty space in a flex container.
* In order to **justify-content** to work, the sum of the widths of flex items needs to be less than 100%.
* **max-width** of 100% can make every image responsive

## Day 10
* Flexbox challenge 02 + some extra optional content

## Day 11
* Flexbox challenge 03
